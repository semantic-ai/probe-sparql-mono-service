Approach,Training Data,Advantages,Disadvantages
Supervised Classification,Labeled data for all classes,High accuracy,Requires a lot of labeled data
Zero-Shot Classification,No labeled data for new classes,Can classify new classes without any labeled data,Lower accuracy than supervised classification
Embedding Similarity,Labeled data for some classes,Can classify new classes without any labeled data for those classes,Lower accuracy than supervised classification
